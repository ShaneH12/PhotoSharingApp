# PhotoSharingApp
A photo sharing app using Reactjs framework and Express.

The app allows for a user to sign in and upload photos that are attributed to a location of the users choosing on a map. 

The uploaded photos are generated with a caption and show what user uploaded the photo.

The photo feed relates to the geo location of the upload. 

A user can scroll to different areas of the map and photos that have been uploaded in those areas will be visible on the photo feed.

If a user scrolls away from a location, the photo feed will change.
